## Getting to the Chaucer building

For those who are not staff or students at NTU, the Chaucer building is located
on Goldsmith Street; the main entrance being adjacent to the Nottingham Trent
University tram stop.  The easiest way to get to Chaucer is via tram from
Nottingham railway station (in which case you can travel direct from Nottingham
Station towards Hucknall/Phoenix Park) and will arrive literally outside
Chaucer after four stops. If travelling by car it is best to travel to the
Forest Park and Ride. Parking is free and you can take the tram for two stops
towards the station. This tram also stops at the Nottingham Trent University
tram stop (but on the other side of the tracks).  Both journeys take about 15
minutes if walking. If travelling by tram purchase a ticket from a machine
before getting on the tram (the ticket machines are easy to use and take cash
or credit/debit cards).
